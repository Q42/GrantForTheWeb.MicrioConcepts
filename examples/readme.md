# Examples & Try-outs

For the examples and try-outs we looked at the Web Monetization implementation by Coil (based on the WM Spec) and how the implementation should work with Coil browser plugin. We explored how multiple usecases would work with this API.

We also have taken a look at the Interledger Protocol, without the SPSP that is provided by the API. For this we tried to do a P2P payment between two wallets on the Interledger Testnet.
