# Examples & Try-outs

For the examples and try-outs we looked at the Web Monetization implementation by Coil (based on the WM Spec) and how the implementation should work with Coil browser plugin. We explored how multiple usecases would work with this API.

We also have taken a look at the Interledger Protocol, without the SPSP that is provided by the API. For this we tried to do a P2P payment between two wallets on the Interledger Testnet.

## [Interledger](https://github.com/Q42/GrantForTheWeb.MicrioConcepts/tree/main/examples/interledger)

This directory lists generic examples based on the Interledger Protocol. Through the Interledger Protocol it is possible to perform payments to other interledger wallets.

## [Web Monetization API](https://github.com/Q42/GrantForTheWeb.MicrioConcepts/tree/main/examples/web-monetization)

This directory lists basic examples based on Micrio and the Web Monetization API.
