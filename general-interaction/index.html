        <h2 class="subtitle">
          With general interaction, actions like zooming, panning and clicking
          are meant. These interactions can explicitly be defined as camera
          movements. During camera movement, new tiles are downloaded and
          bandwidth will be used. In this mode it doesn’t matter what kind of
          content the user is interacting with. It should not matter if the user
          is freely exploring in the webapp or focusing on content that is
          created by a creator like markers, marker-tours and video-tours. On
          these moments the monetization meta-tag should be dynamically added to
          the web-page. For moments that the user does not interact with the
          Micrio instance (or “static moments”), the meta-tag should be removed
          from the web-page. This will close the payment stream.
