# Grant for the Web x Q42

This repository is a collection of examples, prototypes and suggestions that we have developed as part of the Grant for the Web project at Q42. The goal is to research if Web Monetization could be a viable addition or replacement of the Micrio bussinessmodel.

First of all, we did some testing with the API itself. We looked at the draft and how the implementation should with Coil browser plugin. We also have taken a look at the Interledger Protocol, without the SPSP that is provided by the API.

## Examples and try-outs

In the [examples]() directory, you can find multiple examples for the [ILP]() and [Web Monetization API]().
